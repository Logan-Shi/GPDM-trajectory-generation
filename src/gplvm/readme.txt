This is the GPLVM Code used for experiments in the paper 

Gaussian process latent variable models for visualisation of high dimensional data.

Version 1.01 Monday, June 9, 2003 at 18:24:38
Made the 2D visualisation better (image now in center of separate window)
Commented out the .mat file saves from the scripts for recreating the experiments.
Added the missing pdinv.m file.

Version 1.0 Saturday, June 7, 2003 at 04:11:44
Original upload on day of NIPS submission.
